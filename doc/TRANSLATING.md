### Tips

There are issues specific to Cataclysm: DDA which translators should be aware of.
These include the use of terms like `%s` and `%3$d` (leave them as they are),
and the use of tags like `<name>`, which shouldn't be translated.

Information about these and any other issues specific to individual languages,
can be found in Cataclysm: DDA's [language notes folder](../lang/notes).

General notes for all translators are in `README_all_translators.txt`,
and notes specific to a language may be stored as `<lang_id>.txt`,
for example `de.txt` for German.

Cataclysm: DDA has more than 14000 translatable strings, but don't be discouraged.
The more translators there are, the easier it becomes ðŸ˜„.

## Maintainers

Several steps need to be done in the correct order to correctly merge and maintain the translation files.

There are scripts available for these, so usually the process will be as follows:

1. Download the translations in `.po` format.
2. Put them in `lang/incoming/`, ensuring they are named consistently with the files in `lang/po/`.
3. Run `lang/update_pot.sh` to update `lang/po/cataclysm-dda.pot`.
4. Run `lang/merge_po.sh` to update `lang/po/*.po`.

    This will also merge the translations from `lang/incoming/`.

These steps should be enough to keep the translation files up-to-date.

To compile the .po files into `.mo` files for use, run `lang/compile_mo.sh`. It will create a directory in `lang/mo/` for each language found.

Also note that both `lang/merge_po.sh` and `lang/compile_mo.sh` accept arguments specifying which languages to merge or compile. So to compile only the translation for, say, Traditional Chinese (zh_TW), one would run `lang/compile_mo.sh zh_TW`.

After compiling the appropriate .mo file, if your system is using that language, the translations will be automatically used when you run cataclysm.

If your system locale is different from the one you want to test, the easiest way to do so is to find out your locale identifier, compile the translation you want to test, then rename the directory in `lang/mo/` to your locale identifier.

So for example if your local language is New Zealand English (en_NZ), and you want to test the Russian (ru) translation, the steps would be `lang/compile_mo.sh ru`, `mv lang/mo/ru lang/mo/en_NZ`, `./cataclysm`.

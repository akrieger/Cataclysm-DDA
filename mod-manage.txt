Problems:
1. unload already loaded stuff. This is currently not done at all. (at least not propperly as maps/vectors/... just get cleared, but the objects their content points to (itype) is not deleted).
-> find out what needs unloading
-> write propper unload methods.

2. during chargen we need item data (and CBM data, and addiction data,...) this only exists after loading the mod!
-> select the mods to use before starting char gen.

3. What should go into the mod manager?
-> Options? They can be changed before char gen. So probably not.

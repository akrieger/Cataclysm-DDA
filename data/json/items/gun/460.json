    "description": "Developed as a testament to the L39 family of pistols' strength, this hefty pistol chambers powerful .460 Rowland. In addition to the heavy slide and L39 standard sighting package, this pistol sports a large muzzle brake. Normal .45ACP can be fired through the weapon, albeit at reduced accuracy due to the slight freebore. Similar to other Leadworks products it doesn't accept third-party modifications.",

They fire .30 cal bullets using compressed air that we'd make inside the basement and then pipe up to individual storage tanks for the guns that would be good for a few hundred shots each.  The design should be capable of auto or semi-auto fire, at a range that's pretty comparable to a gunpowder-based weapon.  It takes out some of the most limited parts of ranged weapons: no gunpowder, no brass casings, just lead that we melt into my mold.  It's not soundless, but it's not as loud as a chemical weapon.  There are tons of advantages.  Only trouble is, I can't convince the Free Merchants to give me the parts I need.",

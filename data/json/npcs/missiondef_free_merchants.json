In either case, deal with the threat so that the scavengers can continue to pass through in relative safety.  The best reward I can offer is a claim to the supplies they were carrying.",

With 25 plutonium cells we would be able to get an electrical expansion working for a year or two.  I know they are rare but running generators isn't a viable option in the basement.",

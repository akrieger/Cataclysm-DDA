      "Welcome to Mind Over Matter, a psychic powers mod for Cataclysm.  This mod adds psionics to the game, mental powers based on classical concepts of mental powers.  Incinerate zombies as a pyrokinetic, avoid bullets by peering into the near future as a clairsentient, recharge your car as an electrokinetic, run so fast you can run on water as a biokinetic, and more.  All these powers are available to you.",
      "And to your enemies.  The player is not the only one with psionics.",
      "Psionics are different in several ways than the magical powers in Magiclysm.  For one, all psionics require stamina to use rather than an external resource such as mana, meaning a full-charged psion is only a short breather away. Second, psionic powers scale with your intelligence stat and with your Nether Attunement (q.v.) as well as with power level; this even includes their maximum possible level, which is equal to your intelligence times 1.5.  Third, long term powers must be concentrated on to be maintained, and negative effects like being injured, being electrocuted, or inhaling toxic smoke can cause you to lose your concentration.  Lose your concentration when you're levitating or maintaining a pyrokinetic shield against fire and you're in for a world of hurt and possibly the character creation screen.",
      "Mind Over Matter is designed to be as congruent with vanilla as possible, so psionics are rare and most evidence of their existence is confined to secret locations.  It may take some time to gain psionic powers if you start without them.  This is intended.",
      "One last thing: remember to bind the Supernatural Powers key to use your powers!"

      "There are three main ways to gain psionic powers: start the game with them, find and use a matrix crystal, or wait in portal storm.",
      "The first and most obvious is start the game with them.  There are professions for each psionic path (\"Doomseer\" for clairsentience or \"Itzcuauhtli Corps Liaison, Yohualli Ehēcatl Division\" for teleportation), and each path also has a series of three backgrounds labeled Newly-Awakened, Arising, and Ascended.  Newly-Awakened starts you with the absolute minimum possible, only a couple powers.  Arising starts you with a good amount of powers, equivalent to a mid-game character.  Ascended starts you with a very powerful suite of psionics best suited for games where monster difficulty has been significantly increased or other challenges are at play.",
      "The second is to find one of the strange colored crystals now found in the world, and the third is to stand out in a portal storm.  Using a matrix crystal works immediately and standing in a portal storm is a small chance each moment, but the effect is the same.  If you succeed, you gain a power path appropriate to the type of crystal, or randomly in the case of a portal storm.  If you fail, you suffer from negative effects related to your failure.  A failed biokinesis awakening will leave you physically weakened, for example.",
      "Unlike learning spells, psionics are not guaranteed.  Each newly-created character has only a chance to gain powers.  This chance is variable per character, set when your character is created, and can range from 50% to as little as 1%.  Furthermore, every path you learn decreases your odds to learn future paths, though it never becomes impossible.  You may take the Latent Psion trait at character creation to ensure that your first attempt to awaken psionic powers is always successful, but this does affect the diminishing returns of attempting to awaken additional paths.
